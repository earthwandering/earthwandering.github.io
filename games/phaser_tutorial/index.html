  <strong>Hi Ian!</strong>

  <p>
    I was inspired by the games we were playing over the last few weeks to learn about simple two dimensional games.
    I was able to build this game in just a few minutes based on
    <a href="http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1">this online tutorial</a> about the Phaser javascript
    game engine.  <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> was created by software developers that wanted to make game
    development like this very easy.
  </p>
  <p>
    This game is based on the iPhone game Flappy Bird that was very simple, but very popular a few years ago.
  </p>
  <p>USE THE SPACEBAR!</p>
  <p>
    Love, <br />
    Dad<br />
